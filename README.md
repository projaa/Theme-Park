# 3D Theme Park
This is an OpenGL based Computer Graphics project. A 3D theme park is implemented where 9 types of rides are designed. There is a lake around the park and the entrance to the park is connected to a bridge. The lake is surrounded by trees on three sides and fences at the front. The entire scene is enclosed within a texture-mapped cube called SkyBox. This results in a realistic sky effect. It engages computer graphics concepts such as 3D modeling, lighting, shading, texture mapping, animation, and user interaction. Different types of glut, gl, glu libraries are used to draw the objects.
